//! Literal fixture for the user-facing failure copy (wave 5 "error copy table").
//!
//! Captured from the pre-refactor behaviour: for each failure class the exact
//! `error_type` wire token, `source`, `retryable`, retry-after, provider,
//! fallback flag and user copy. The refactor into one host copy table must keep
//! every row byte-identical. The budget-phrase section additionally compares the
//! shared matcher against verbatim copies of the three legacy matchers
//! (web_chat regex list, triage whole-word list, loop-guard billing list).
